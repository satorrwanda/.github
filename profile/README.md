## 1. **Welcome!**
   Welcome to Sator-Rwanda Ltd! These guidelines provide everything you need to contribute effectively to our projects.
   This guide will walk you through our contribution process. Please focus on tasks assigned by the project lead, but you are also encouraged to open issues if you identify potential improvements. The project lead will review and assign these issues as tasks if approved.

## 2. **Code of Conduct**
   Please review and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html) to ensure a respectful and collaborative environment for all team members.



## 3. **Working on Assigned Tasks**
   - **Task Scope**: Work only on tasks explicitly assigned to you. If you have ideas for improvements, open an issue for review by the project lead.
   - **Progress Updates**: Provide updates to your team lead, especially for complex or extended tasks.



## 4. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
   1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/satorrwanda/repository-name.git`

## 5. **Issue Reporting and Suggesting Improvements**
   - **Report Task-Related Issues**: If you encounter bugs or blockers, document them and report to your team lead.

## 6. **Creating a New Branch and Committing Changes**
   1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names that align with the assigned task (`git checkout -b task/task-name`).
   2. **Commit Regularly**: Use clear commit messages that describe your changes (`git commit -m 'Description of the changes'`).
   3. **Push Your Branch**: Use `git push origin task/task-name` to submit your branch.



## 7. **Opening a Pull Request (PR)**

   - **Clear PR Description**: Provide a concise summary of your changes and link any related issues if relevant.
   - **Review and Feedback**: Address any feedback to keep the PR review process efficient.



## 8. **Code Standards**
   - **Project Coding Style**: Adhere to project-specific style guides (e.g., [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), or equivalent).
   - **Readability and Clarity**: Use clear variable names and add comments where needed, especially for complex logic.



## 9. **Testing**
   - **Write Tests**: Add relevant unit or integration tests for new features or fixes within your task scope.
   - **Run Tests Locally**: Execute tests before submitting your PR (`npm test` or other project-specific command).
