## Satorwanda Software Development Team Code of Conduct

### Introduction
As a software development team at Satorwanda, we are committed to fostering a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment that supports innovation and excellence in our projects. This Code of Conduct outlines the behaviors, values, and professional standards expected from all team members. Our collective success depends on mutual respect, integrity, and open communication.

### 1. **Respectful Communication**
We believe in transparent and respectful communication. All team members are encouraged to express ideas, concerns, and feedback in a constructive manner. Active listening and understanding different perspectives are essential for fostering a positive and productive work environment.

- **Be open to feedback** – Constructive criticism helps us grow. Approach code reviews and suggestions with an open mind.
- **Be respectful in discussions** – Avoid personal attacks, insults, or dismissive language, especially during challenging conversations.

### 2. **Collaboration and Teamwork**
Software development is a collaborative process. We work together, share knowledge, and support each other to deliver the best solutions. It is important to be supportive, collaborative, and approachable, particularly when working on shared codebases or tackling complex problems.

- **Pair programming** – Engage in pair programming sessions to improve code quality and share knowledge.
- **Knowledge sharing** – Contribute to team knowledge through documentation, sharing insights during standups, and helping peers solve challenges.
- **Respect deadlines** – Be mindful of deadlines and communicate early if there are potential delays.

### 3. **Quality Code and Best Practices**
Our commitment to quality is reflected in the code we write. Every team member is responsible for following best practices, and ensuring maintainability, readability, and scalability of the codebase. This is essential not only for the project’s success but also for creating a positive experience for future contributors.

- **Code reviews** – Actively participate in code reviews, both as a reviewer and a reviewee. Provide constructive feedback and take feedback gracefully.
- **Follow coding standards** – Adhere to the team’s coding guidelines and conventions (e.g., naming conventions, indentation).
- **Test-driven development (TDD)** – Prioritize writing unit tests and ensuring the robustness of the code.
- **Documentation** – Write clear documentation for your code and workflows, ensuring it is understandable for current and future team members.

### 4. **Accountability and Responsibility**
Each team member is responsible for their own work, including writing code, testing, and fixing bugs. However, we also hold ourselves accountable as a team, working together to address issues promptly and ensuring the overall health of the codebase.

- **Own your work** – Take responsibility for the quality of your code and its delivery. If an issue arises, acknowledge it and work towards a solution.
- **Ask for help when needed** – No one knows everything. Don’t hesitate to ask for help, guidance, or clarification when needed.

### 5. **Respect for Time**
Time management is crucial in a software development environment. We value the time of every team member and ensure that our efforts are aligned toward achieving the project’s goals efficiently.

- **Minimize distractions** – Avoid unnecessary interruptions during deep work or pair programming sessions.
- **Be mindful of meetings** – Respect the time of others by staying on topic and keeping meetings productive.

### 6. **Continuous Improvement and Learning**
The software development field is constantly evolving. We embrace a culture of continuous learning, staying up-to-date with new technologies, tools, and best practices.

- **Invest in personal growth** – Regularly review new frameworks, languages, and tools to improve your skill set.
- **Attend learning sessions** – Participate in team knowledge-sharing sessions, workshops, and external learning opportunities.
- **Embrace change** – Be open to adopting new technologies and methods that improve the development process.

### 7. **No Tolerance for Discriminatory or Abusive Behavior**

- **Diversity and inclusion** – Everyone should feel respected, regardless of background, gender, ethnicity, or identity.
